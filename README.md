# Spotify---Database-Management

Introduction

The objective of this project was to create a database for Spotify to store and analyze user data and associated metadata including subscription type, playlists, number of likes, play count,  artists, and genres to get insights into user preferences and behavior.
1. Data Collection: The first step in this project was to collect the data. I conducted a survey of graduate students at the Robert H. Smith School of Business to collect their playlist data to get access to the songs and artists they listen to.
2. ER and Relational Schema: I developed a comprehensive schema, including entities, relationships, and 32 business rules, to ensure a well-organized and consistent database.
3. Physical Database Design: I created 15 interconnected tables to store and manage data effectively, supporting data integrity and easy access. I also inserted the data collected through the survey into these tables.
4. Querying and Visualization: Utilized SQL and Tableau to perform queries and generate visualizations, to provide insights into user behavior and preferences.

Key Insights and Discoveries:-

1. Top 5 Popular Songs: Identified the most popular songs on Spotify by looking at the total number of plays by users to come up with a list of the most popular songs.This helped reveal user preferences and could be used to inform data-driven marketing strategies.
2. Most Liked Artists by Genre: Discovered the artists with the highest number of likes in each genre, showing the platform's top performers and the most popular music styles.
3. Genre Diversity: Identified the number of songs in each genre, to understand the diversity of the Spotify catalog.
4. Most Liked Artist Insights: Determined the most liked artists overall, to gauge their popularity and influence within the Spotify ecosystem.
